Rules:
1.) No racial, sexist, religious, ageist, etc. slurs (no talk about religious or political stances) with the intention to attack the other person, this will result in a temporary timeout, if repeated it will result in a ban
2.) Do not post pictures containing: gore, sexual, or offensive images with the intent to shock, disturb, or offend another person, this will result in a temporary timeout, if repeated it will result in a ban (except for the meme channel, we understand everyone has a different kind of humor, but enter the meme channel at your own risk. Still no images containing gore, heavy sexual content, and spam of ANY kind.) This will result in a temporary timeout, if repeated it will result in a ban
3.) Do not spam messages and/or images within any channel, this will result in a temporary timeout, if repeated it will result in a ban
4.) When in the voice channel, do not talk with the intention of offending the other person (see rule #1 as it follows the same guidelines, but this is for voice chat)
5.) If an admin advises you to stop a certain action and you do not comply, this will result in a temporary timeout, if repeated it will result in a ban
6.) If the player is part of a separate guild (other than a small group of friends in a separate Discord) then such player can join The Guardian Guild, but only at the rank of "Guest". Having this rank will only allow the "Guest" to chat in the #general and #help discussion channel (being in the The Guardian Guild Discord still means you will have to help others in the AQ3D community and guild. If said player leaves their current guild(s), they may become a fully-fledged member of The Guardian Guild.) If a "Guest" exhibits any act against the guild, Admins, or anything to be classified as "trouble", they will be removed from the guild Discord.
7.) If you are in The Guardian Guild Discord chat, do not advertise, promote, or bring separate guild affairs into the #general nor #help channel. In doing so, you will be removed from The Guardian Guild Discord chat and will not be able to return. (Even if said player leaves their current guild in the hopes of joining The Guardian Guild.)
