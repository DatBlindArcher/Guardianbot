Recruitment rules:
1.) Player MUST be a Guardian! (there can be a very rare and very specific case, where the player is a non - Guardian, but can join because the player will be recieving Guardian in the near future.If the player does not recieve Guardian in the span of one week, they will be kicked and will only be allowed back if they purchase Guardian and obtain Guardian status)
2.) Have/Make a Discord account! (We cannot communicate and keep track of current members without a Discord, if the player does not have a Discord account, they will be advised to download the application and create an account. If the player does have a Discord account, they will need to be asked their name, example: "The Dragon Guardian" then ask for the four numbers after, "#2309". Now send a message to the player's Discord, whether it's new or not, and send the guild Discord server hyper link. You go to the small tab with the guild name, click "invite people" then copy the guild hyperlink and paste into the potential new members Discord private messages)
3.) Help others! Guardian or not! (We are a guild that focuses on helping others and building upon and benefitting the community. Without helping and guiding new players, our goal will fail)
4.) Ability to type fluent English! (While The Guardian Guild is a diverse guild, we all speak a common language of English, this is an absolute necessity if new Guardians wish to communicate with other Guardians and a majority of the AQ3D player base)
5.) Be active! (We of The Guardian Guild understand that being online 24/7 is absurd, however, with the goal of helping others, we need active Guardians. With a minimum of a two day log in onto the Discord, help at least one person and then you can leave)
